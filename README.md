# A Sample Application: Flight Booker

## This application was made for educational purposes only and obviously does
## not have all the features of a full web application that one might expect.

This project was created in an attempt to learn more about creating and structuring advanced Ruby on Rails forms with nested attributes, handling nested attributes in the controller, and Rails associations. Clearly, this app was no lesson on front-end web design.

If I'm to be honest, this project was also a painful lesson
about dates, which I find to be incredibly hard to work with using Rails.
